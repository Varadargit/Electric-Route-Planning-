# Electric-Route-Planning-
 The Electric Route Optimizer (ERO) is a web-based application designed to help electric vehicle (EV) drivers plan the most efficient routes considering their battery range, charging station availability, and other relevant factors. The goal of this system is to alleviate range anxiety and make long-distance EV travel.

 
Workflow:
Input Handling: The user provides key data, including battery percentage, EV range, current location, and destination coordinates.
Route Calculation: The system processes the input to determine if the destination is within range, and if not, calculates the nearest charging stations on the route for possible stops.
Output Presentation: The results are displayed on the page, showing:
The optimal route with stops at charging stations.
Charging station details (e.g., connector types, available capacity, status).
Edge Case Management: If the route isn't feasible, the system offers alternatives or informs the user of potential issues, such as insufficient battery or unavailable charging stations.
